# KUSelfTour
Codebase for the Interdisciplinary Team Project (CDE335/CSC354) Project

KUSelfTour is an android application that allows an android device user to use their device's camera to display the name of the building the camera is currently viewing. The user can then select this building and access multiple levels of information. Also included is a Google Maps-esque map that allows the user to select buildings based on their proximity and allows them to see their exact location while on campus.
